        according to the first answer here:
        https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1876615/rotation-matrix-from-plane-a-to-b

        * c: (batch, 3) or (3, ). point(s) of the plane
        Outputs: orthonomal basis as a matrix of [e1, e2, e3]. calculated as: 
            * e1_ = (c-b)
            * e2_proto = (b-a)

        Note: Could be done more by Grahm-Schmidt and extend to N-dimensions
              but this is faster and more intuitive for 3D.
